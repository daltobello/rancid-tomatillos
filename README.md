## Context:

This is a group project during Mod 3 at Turing School of Software & Design. We were given approximately 2 weeks to create this project from scratch using the [provided comp](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/rancid-tomatillos-v3.html).

## Learning Goals:
- Gain competency with React fundamentals
- Test React components & asynchronous JS
- Practice refactoring
- Create a multi-page UX using Router

## Challenges:
- React: This was both of our first react applications. We enjoyed learning the new library/framework as it allows for more rapid application development than vanilla JS alone.
- Search: Creating search functionality that worked well with the phases of the react component lifecycle proved slightly challenging. We used specific ternaries as well as a state to determine if a search had been made in the application yet, which assisted our ability to display if the movie posters were loading or if there was no movie meeting that search criteria.
